A loan shark is a person within a personal or professional network offering to provide loans such as personal loans at high interest rates. They may be found in underbanked neighborhoods, on the internet, or through personal networks. Their funds are usually from unidentified sources, and they work for personal businesses or unregistered entities.1

Loan sharks do not require background checks or credit reports. They will lend large sums of money with the intention of gaining high levels of interest in a short time. Loans from loan sharks charge interest rates far above any regulated rate. For example, a loan shark might lend $1,000 to a person with the provision that $100 be repaid within 30 days. These lenders may also call on the debt to be repaid at any time, using violence as a means of forcing repayment.
